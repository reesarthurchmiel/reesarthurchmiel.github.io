## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS

### What I learnt

I learnt a lot during this project. The most exciting bit for me was using BEM and CSS variables to create a reusable image slideshow component that could be reused with easily changed properties for different situations. I used this slideshow component in both the main page and the lightbox gallery. I also enjoyed learning about CSS transitions, which I used on the mobile navigation pane and the slideshow. Perfecting small details like transitions greatly improve the feel of the UX and made the whole project more polished, which I am really pleased by. Lastly, I learnt a useful trick to re-colour SVG images with the `filter` property, and with the `fill` property. 

### Continued development

Using BEM for this project was a useful strategy to keep my HTML and CSS readable, but I can see that in a larger codebase it would get unwieldy quickly. For future development I would like to learn a component framework, such as React or Vue, and use CSS-in-JS. I have been researching possible options, and Emotion looks the best.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I completed their Front-end Developer course to refresh my skills and learn the latest best practices.
- [Josh W Comeau's transitions tutorial](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/) - This is a beautiful article written by someone clearly skilled at CSS. It was a joy to read and I cannot recommend it enough.
