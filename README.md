## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS

### What I learnt

I learnt a lot during this project. The most exciting bit for me was using BEM and CSS variables to create a reusable image slideshow component that could be reused with easily changed properties for different situations. I used this slideshow component in the main page and the lightbox gallery. I also enjoyed learning about CSS transitions, which I used on the mobile navigation pane and the slideshow. Lastly, I learnt a useful trick to re-colour SVG images with the `filter` property, and with the `fill` property. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Using BEM for this project was a useful strategy to keep my HTML and CSS readable, but I can see that in a larger codebase it would get unwieldy quickly. For future development I would like to learn a component framework, such as React or Vue, and use CSS-in-JS.

### Useful resources
